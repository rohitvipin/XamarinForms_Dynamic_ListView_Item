# XamarinForms_Dynamic_ListView_Item

This is a Proof of Concept for having dynamic view for ListView Item.
Its based on the StackOverflow question - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/38702566/xamarin-forms-dynamic-list-view/38703629?noredirect=1#comment64864337_38703629

Currently this works for Android. 
iOS version has bug of controls overlapping the next item when show or hide is changed.
